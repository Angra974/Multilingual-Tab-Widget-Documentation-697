# Acteon

## The Tale of Acteon

*In ancient times of mythological belief,*  
*Acteon, a young prince and hunter chief,*  
*For having glimpsed Diana at her bath,*  
*Was turned into a stag, facing nature's wrath.*  
*His own hounds, unable to recognize their master,*  
*Devoured him, leading to his cruel disaster.*

## The Moral

**Curiosity has always been a flaw**  
*That often leads us further than we ought to go.*  
*Those who wish to know too much, to observe too far,*  
*Risk being devoured by those who know who they are.*

## Reflection

This fable teaches us that misplaced curiosity can have dramatic consequences. It invites us to respect others' privacy and know when to keep our distance.
