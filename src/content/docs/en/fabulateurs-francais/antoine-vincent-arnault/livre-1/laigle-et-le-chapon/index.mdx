# The Eagle and the Capon

## The Fable

*An eagle pursued a capon in the yard,*  
*When the latter, cunning, found this clever card:*  
*"O king of skies," said he, "is it worthy of your might,*  
*To chase the humblest creature in broad daylight?*  
*An eagle such as you, so noble and so strong,*  
*Should not stoop to hunt a capon for too long."*

*The eagle, flattered, halted in his chase,*  
*Allowing his prey to flee to a safer place.*  
*The capon, saved by wit more than by wing,*  
*Proved that in crisis, cunning is the thing.*

## The Moral

**Intelligence often surpasses might**  
*And well-chosen words can save a life.*  
*When facing the powerful, a clever mind*  
*Can help the weak leave danger far behind.*
